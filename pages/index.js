                  you were one of the people on the zephyr that honestly made it a lifechanging experience for me. From straight up asking the real political questions to ice cream man, to being an accomplice in walking away from a mugging with me (we don't need to discuss the specifics). We all love you, even though you may like apple a bittttt too much (eh who am I to judge lol). 

                  Thanks so much for everything, and I hope you have an amazing 17th (or 45th since you're the old man of HackClub)

                  Getting off your lawn,

        Hey Charlie!

        I'd like to with you a *wonderful* birthday!

        Thanks for being an amazing and supportive friend on the slack, and someone who genuinely cares about the things you work on and talk about. It's wonderful seeing the passion you have for what you do, and I really hope you're able to grow your work into something even bigger!
        Interacting with you on the Zephyr was similarly fun; and you've inspired me to learn to code outside of my comfort zone. I appreciate you for your honesty (even when it can be hard to hear).

        Here's to a continued future!
        Claire
